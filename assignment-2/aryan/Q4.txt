Worst runtime case:
array is sorted in descending order with all value distinct. 
initially, i=j=0; therefore while loop runs 0 times.
i=1, j= 0->1 while loop runs 1 time.
i=2, j= 1->2 while loop runs 1 time.
.
.
.
i=n-1, j=n-2->n-1 while loop runs 1 time.

Total no. of iterations: n-1 
Time complexity: O(n)
